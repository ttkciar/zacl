====

ZACL is a high-level programming language, influenced by python, C, and perl.

### ZACL's A Concurrency Language.

ZACL supports concurrent and distributed computation as intrinsic language features.

### ZACL's A Compiled Language.

ZACL compiles to native executable binaries via an LLVM back-end.

ZACL can also "fake it" as if it were an interpreted scripting language, compiling transparently and running immediately, a la python or perl.

### ZACL's A Compact Language.

ZACL avoids unnecessary boilerplate, allowing programmers to use the language features they need, and ignore the features they don't.

ZACL is also more memory-efficient than some high-level dynamic languages, using compact implementations for explicitly-typed data structures.

...

ZACL is also a work-in-progress, and transferring the creative process from my private files to a public github frankly scares the crap out of me.  But other people are interested in contributing to the project, so scribbling in notebooks isn't going to cut it anymore.  Expect sporadic updates.

See the wiki for technical information and collaboration.  For ZACL-related blather, [see my blog on LQ](http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/blog/ttk-652585/).
